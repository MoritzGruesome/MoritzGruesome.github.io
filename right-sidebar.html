											<h2>Vr Horrorgame</h2>
											<p>Programmed in C# using the Unity engine</p>

											In this project, I worked in a team of 7 people to create a horrorgame. We worked on it for 4 weeks, through which I was the product owner, responsible for
											maintining a vision for the game. The concept of the game was to create a cheap entry to Virtual reality based games. The game was made to be played
											on a phone, where you would look around by moving your phone and press a button to move forward in the direction of view. You play as a ghost hunter inspired by "spökjakten"
											in sweden, who is trying to build his brand on social media. The game takes place in a haunted asylum in which the player goes live on stream. During the stream the player must both find 
											and avoid monsters of different types. Filming monsters increase the number of viewers on the stream thus increasing likes (which is the points system), The player is directed by the
											live chat about which monsters they want to see. Filming monsters of interest gains more views and filming no monsters loses views. The link to the website of the game can be found here:
